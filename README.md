# Personalization
<br> The background generated from Bing is 1024x1024, to add background to game windows, I cropped and resized the background and the game windows size to 1280x720.</br>
<br>You can easily change the background and the ball yourself. Just replace the image by your files. But rezise them before replacing, the background should be 1280x720px and the ball should be 50x50px</br>
**Remember, keep the file name exacly.**
