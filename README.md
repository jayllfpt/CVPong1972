# Personalization
<br> The background generated from Bing is 1024x1024, to add background to game windows, I cropped and resized the background and the game windows size to 1280x720.</br>
<br>You can easily change the background and the ball yourself. Just replace the image by your files. </br>
**Remember, keep the file name exacly.**
